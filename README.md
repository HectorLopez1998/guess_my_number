Learning JS by creating fun projects!
You will find a lot of comments in these projects.
This is because I am learning JS and writing as much information as I can about how my code works helps me have a better understanding of it.
It also reinforces what I am learning and helps me retain the information.
Thank you for stopping by and please take a look around!
Enjoy making fun of my code ðŸ¤£
Feedback is greatly appreciate it!
